# A-Non-negative-Spike-and-slab-Lasso-Generalized-Linear-Stacking-Model
# "0.1 get simudata" is to generate simulation data.
# "1.0 stacking(lasso)" is the main procedure for the stacking strategy using the Lasso as base learner and three super learners namely L-BFGS, nlasso and nsslasso.
# Other files are some of the functions required to fit the stacking process.
